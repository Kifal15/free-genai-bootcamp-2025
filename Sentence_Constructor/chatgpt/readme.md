## Which Model Is Used?
This guide uses the **free version of ChatGPT**, which currently defaults to **ChatGPT-4-Turbo**. This model offers:
- Performance comparable to earlier GPT-4 versions.
- Improved efficiency and faster response times.

## Prompting Guides
For best practices on interacting with ChatGPT, refer to OpenAI’s official guide:  
[OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)

Key takeaways:
- Clearly state your goal or question.
- Provide context where necessary (e.g., "Explain like I'm 5" or "Write a Python script for...").
- Iterate and refine prompts based on responses.

## Usage Tips
### No Special Formatting Required
Unlike some AI tools, **ChatGPT does not require specific syntax** (e.g., markdown, brackets) to understand context. Simply write naturally, as you would with Meta AI or similar assistants.

Examples:
- ✅ **Good**: "Help me draft an email for a job application."
- ✅ **Also Good**: "I need a poem about autumn in Shakespearean style."

### Optimizing Interactions
- **Be specific**: Add details like tone, length, or examples.
- **Correct mistakes**: Say "That’s incorrect—try again with updated data" to refine responses.
- **Break down complex tasks**: Split requests into smaller steps if needed.
