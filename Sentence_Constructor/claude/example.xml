Clues, considerations, and next steps:

- You've correctly identified "Mein" (I) as the subject.
- "Jana" is the base form of "to go," but in this context, it should be conjugated correctly for the present tense.
- "Sūparmārkiṭ" (supermarket) is correct.
- "Bohot zyada" (a lot) and "traffic" are used correctly.
- You're very close! Just focus on refining the verb conjugation for "I'm going." Give it another try!
